# LogoPG
Siemens (tm) LOGO! library for Arduino

The library is based on the implementation of Settimino. Only LOGO 0BA4 to 0BA6 are supported via the serial programming interface.

The current library version is 0.4.3 (not final, release candidate 4, with patchlevel 3).

All information about the protocol is described in a separate document: [PG-Protocol.md](/doc/PG-Protocol.md)
