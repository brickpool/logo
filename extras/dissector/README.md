# LOGO! PG Dissector
A Wireshark dissector for the serial LOGO PG protocol used by the _LOGO!_ PLC

__logopg.lua__ is a small (and not complete!) Wireshark dissector for the serial PG protocol that is exchanged between the PC and the _LOGO!_. 

The Dissector is tested with the Serial port capture program [SerialPCAP](https://github.com/j123b567/SerialPCAP), written by Jan Breuer.
